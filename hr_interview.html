    <h1 class="display-4"> Why Companies Takes HR Round?</h1>
    <p class="lead">

        Companies include HR rounds in their hiring processes to evaluate candidates beyond technical skills. HR assesses cultural fit, ensuring candidates align with company values and team dynamics. They also gauge soft skills like communication and problem-solving, crucial for workplace success. HR rounds handle salary negotiations, ensuring mutual agreement on compensation and benefits. Additionally, these rounds verify references, conduct background checks, and ensure compliance with employment laws. Ultimately, HR serves as the final gatekeeper, confirming a candidate’s suitability before extending an offer, minimizing hiring risks. Overall, HR rounds ensure holistic candidate assessment, fostering a cohesive and productive work environment..</p>
<p class="lead">   

    In addition to assessing cultural fit and soft skills, HR rounds serve to communicate the company’s mission, values, and expectations to candidates. They provide an opportunity for candidates to ask questions about company culture, career development opportunities, and workplace policies. HR professionals also assess a candidate’s enthusiasm and commitment to the role and organization, seeking individuals who demonstrate genuine interest and alignment with the company’s long-term goals. Moreover, HR rounds facilitate diversity and inclusion initiatives by ensuring fair and equitable hiring practices. By addressing these aspects, HR rounds contribute to building a motivated and diverse workforce that drives organizational success.</p>
    <p class="lead">HR professionals may delve deeper into a candidate's career aspirations and professional goals, aligning them with available opportunities within the company. Furthermore, these rounds often involve discussing potential challenges of the role and how candidates approach problem-solving and decision-making in such contexts. This thorough evaluation ensures that candidates not only possess the technical skills but also possess the mindset and vision necessary to contribute effectively to the company's growth and success.</p>

    <p>“Thank you, Sir/Ma’am for this opportunity. I am from XYZ City and belong to a nuclear family.

      My father is a Central Government Employee and my mother is a Vice Principal at a private school.
      
      My younger sister will appear her CBSE 10 board this year.
      
      We are a very close-knit family. On an individual front, I perceive myself as a confident, conscientious and hardworking individual.
      
      I carry out any task assigned to me without hesitation, provided the instructions are clear. In the case of doubts, I never hesitate to put forth my questions.
      
      I have always been a fast learner, and I love to keep up my process of learning to figure out better ways of solving problems.
      
      Moreover, I love to compete with my own past performances than competing with my peers, as I believe that improvement is always better than perfection!”</p>

  <div class="answer">
    <p>“I have several strengths namely – I am patient, committed, honest and self-motivated.

      I am the biggest dreamer I have ever come across! I forgive easily and hate to keep grudges in my heart.
      
      My greatest weakness is that I don't like getting interrupted when I am seriously into something.
      
      Another one of my weaknesses is that I trust people very easily.
      
      As I already said, I am a very patient person, so I am actively working on this lacuna.”</p>

</div>
<div class="question-card">
  <h5>Question 5 </h5>
  <p>What is your greatest fear?</p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary show-answer-btn">Show Answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>“You might think that since I have never worked in my life, and this is only my first job, my inexperience is my weakness.

      But I beg to differ. I am a fast learner and very open minded.
      
      I assure that I do not carry any pre-conceived notions regarding how I feel I should perform my job.”</p>

  <div class="answer">
    <p>“I do not have severe health issues, but I do have a migraine issue.

      I have never disclosed my condition on a job interview before or on a pre-employment health questionnaire, as I was afraid that it might jeopardize my career.
      
      But I am undergoing both acute (abortive) and preventive (prophylactic) therapies and most of my colleagues know about it.
      
      The situation is completely under control and I have been almost cured.”</p>

  <h5>Question 7 </h5>
  <p>Did you ever have a conflict with your current/previous boss or professor?</p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary show-answer-btn">Show Answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>“Recently I had a disagreement with one of my professors about a question that was out of syllabus in one of the semester exams.

      It was not a major one, but yes I will label it a ‘conflict’.
      
      Most of my friends and peers did not attempt this question due to ambiguity.
      
      When I brought the cause into my professor’s notice in private, he remained cold and unconcerned.
      
      So, I and my batchmates had a discussion following which, we went to him together.
      
      At that point, our professor agreed that the question was ambiguous, but he refused to give us grace marks for the same.
      
      I felt disappointed because he did not appreciate the fact that I brought the situation earlier, into his notice in private.
      
      Besides, he did not suggest an alternative paper or project work, with which students could make up for the lost marks.”</p>

<div class="question-card">
  <h5>Question 8 </h5>
  <p>What do your friends/co-workers say about you?</p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary show-answer-btn">Show Answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>“Since I like to build strong professional relationships with my teammates, most of them have become great friends.

      We have been spending eight hours a day, five days a week for several years now.
      
      So, I am sure that whatever they say, will be realistic and not made up.
      
      One thing that they will surely mention about me is my love for food! The rest is up to you to find out.”</p>

<div class="question-card">
  <h5>Question 9 </h5>
  <p>What did you do in the last year to improve your knowledge?</p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary show-answer-btn">Show Answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>“In 2016, I was in the final year of college. During that time, I did three things to improve my knowledge.<br>

     1. I got myself enrolled in Aptech for the Sun Certified Java Programmer course. I will appear my exam soon.
      <br>
     2. I have bought magazine subscriptions such as Dataquest. These magazines help me to stay well informed about new topics in the IT world.
      <br>
     3. I completed my final year application project based on Java. The topic was Centralized Remote Based College Information Scheme.”</p>

  <h5>Question 10 </h5>
  <p>Explain the difference between group and team. Are you a team player?</p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary show-answer-btn">Show Answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>“Yes I am. During my summer internship at Cadence, me and my friends were working together.

      Ours was a mixed group with varied skills and we produced results which would have been impossible to produce individually.
      
      I had to keep all my communication channels open at all times to ensure that the project stayed on track.
      
      I was responsible for my part of the code and also for the collective delivery of the entire project.
      
      I worked closely with senior key team members to keep my deliverables on track.
      
      In the end, I was able to deliver on time and within budget.”</p>

  <div class="answer">
    <p>“I am a fresher and I hardly have any exposure of the corporate world.

      Back in college, weekends were no different from weekdays for us.
      
      The assignments, tasks and projects had to be submitted within deadlines, and to do so, we would study during the weekdays.
      
      As far as night shifts are concerned, I would like to say that I am a nocturnal person and I like to do my studies generally at night.
      
      I have no issues working during weekends and at night, provided I get enough compensatory offs to relax and wind down.”</p>
