    <h1 class="display-4"> Why Companies Takes Technical Round?</h1>
    <p class="lead">
Companies conduct technical interviews primarily to assess the technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and suitability of candidates for specific roles. These interviews serve as a crucial step in the hiring process, aiming to evaluate whether applicants possess the necessary knowledge and expertise to excel in the position they are applying for.</p>
<p class="lead">   
    Firstly, technical interviews help companies gauge the depth and breadth of a candidate's technical knowledge. This includes assessing their understanding of fundamental concepts, practical skills, and proficiency in relevant technologies or programming languages. For roles requiring specialized expertise such as software engineering, data analysis, or IT support, these assessments ensure that candidates have the technical acumen needed to contribute effectively from day one.</p>
    <p class="lead">Secondly, technical interviews are designed to evaluate problem-solving capabilities under pressure. Beyond theoretical knowledge, employers are keen to see how candidates approach and tackle real-world challenges. This often involves presenting candidates with complex scenarios or coding tasks to observe their analytical thinking, creativity in finding solutions, and ability to apply their knowledge in practical situations. Such assessments provide insights into how candidates might handle the demands and complexities of the role.</p>

  <button class="btn btn-primary show-answer-btn">Show Answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>As we know, that this refers to the current class object, therefore, it must be similar to the current class object. However, there can be two main advantages of passing this into a method instead of the current class object.</p>
    <p>This is a final variable. Therefore, this cannot be assigned to any new value whereas the current class object might not be final and can be changed.</p>
<p>This can be used in the synchronized block</p>

<div class="question-card">
  <h5>Question 14</h5>
  <p> What is the ACID property in a database?</p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary show-answer-btn">Show Answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>To ensure that the data transactions are processed reliably in a database system we use the ACID property.</p>
    <p><b>Atomicity:</b>It states that each transaction is all or nothing. It states that the entire transaction fails if one part of the transaction fails and the database state is left unchanged.</p>
<p><b>Consistency:</b>It ensures that the data must follow all validation rules. According to this a transaction never leaves your database without its state being completed</p>
<p><b>Isolation:</b>The main goal of providing isolation is concurrency control. This property ensures that the concurrent property of execution should not be met.</p>
<p><b>Durability:</b>this property states that once a transaction has been committed, it remains committed, whatever the situation be, even power loss, crashes, or errors</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="question-card">
  <h5>Question 15</h5>
  <p> What is selection sort? </p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary show-answer-btn">Show Answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>In the selection sort technique, the list is divided into two parts. In one part all elements are sorted and in another part the items are unsorted. At first we take the maximum or minimum data from the array. After getting the data (say minimum) we place it at the beginning of the list by replacing the data of first place with the minimum data.</p>

  <p> What is Big O notation?</p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary show-answer-btn">Show Answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>Big O notation is a way of expressing the time complexity of an algorithm. It is a measure of how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of the input grows. For example, an algorithm that has a time complexity of O(n) means that the running time of the algorithm grows linearly as the size of the input grows.</p>

  <h5>Question 27</h5>
  <p>. Explain the differences between REST and SOAP web services. </p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary show-answer-btn">Show Answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>REST stands for Representational State Transfer and SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. They are used for accessing web services and the principal difference between them is that REST is an architectural pattern for data transmission and SOAP is a communications protocol. This means that REST can use SOAP as an underlying protocol, but SOAP, being a protocol, cannot use REST.
      REST can work with HTML, XML, JSON and plain text, while SOAP can only work with XML formats. REST uses Uniform Service locators to access a hardware device's components, while SOAP uses service interfaces to provide information about its functionality to client applications. REST requires less bandwidth than SOAP."</p>

  <h5>Question 28</h5>
  <p>Compare waterfall and agile models and provide examples of their use cases </p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary show-answer-btn">Show Answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>The waterfall methodology is a sequential process where tasks are handled in a linear fashion. Generally, it’s best used when the requirements are clear, well-known, and entirely fixed.

      The agile methodology uses an iterative process that relies on cyclic patterns with a high degree of collaboration. Agile provides ample room for feedback and future adjustments, making it a better fit in cases where goals and requirements may shift, or other unknowns are likely to arise.
      
      With this answer, you can dive into examples from your past work to serve as use cases. That can add something extra to your response and may help you stand out.</p>

  <h5>Question 29</h5>
  <p>  Explain the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP)</p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary show-answer-btn">Show Answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>Object-oriented programming is a model that centers on data fields with distinct behaviors and attributes — referred to as objects — instead of logic or functions. Developers focus on the objects that need to be manipulated instead of the processes required to manipulate them.

      Like the question above, you can use examples from past projects to make your answer more compelling and show your understanding of differences between functional programming and OOP.</p>

  <h5>Question 30 </h5>
  <p>What does CORS mean and how does it work? </p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary show-answer-btn">Show Answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>“Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a “preflight” request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.”</p>
